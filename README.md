# 572-Project
## Hayden Church & Khushi Bhatt

# Scraping & Data Collection
Scraping code can be found in the Working Notebooks directory in the plotting.ipynb file. The data collection from yfinance can be found in the datacollect.ipynb file.

# Data
The actual CSV of all data can be found in the Data directory in the SP500.csv file.

# Code
There are several iterations of code throughout the repo, but the code used for the final iteration of the project is contained in the Working Notebooks directory. 

hayden_plotting.ipynb contains the network construction code, the partition code, null models code, degree distribution code, and most relevant statistics code. 

copy_plotting.ipynb contains the Katz centrality code. 

plotting.ipynb contains primitive versions of network construction, degree distributions and null models code.

hayden_plotting.ipynb and copy_plotting should be treated as the final versions of the code, as this is were all of the data, figures, statistics for the final iteration have come from. 

hayden_plotting.ipynb in particular contains a huge amount of irrelevant graphs that were made for deeper understanding of the network that do not necessarily align with anything in the paper.
